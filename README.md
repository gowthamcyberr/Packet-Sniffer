Packet Sniffer 

Objective:

The Packet Sniffer project aims to develop a tool for capturing and analyzing network packets to monitor and troubleshoot network activity. The primary focus is to build a system that can intercept network traffic, parse packet data, and provide insights into network behavior, enabling the identification of potential security threats or performance issues.

Skills Learned:





Network Programming: Proficiency in writing code to capture and analyze packets.



Protocol Knowledge: Deep understanding of network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP).



Data Parsing: Ability to parse and interpret raw packet data accurately.



Security Monitoring: Familiarity with network security concepts for threat detection.



Problem Solving: Enhanced skills in diagnosing and resolving network issues.

Tools Used:





Python (Scapy/Pyshark): For capturing and analyzing network packets programmatically.



Wireshark: For manual inspection and validation of captured packets.



Network Interfaces: Ethernet or Wi-Fi interfaces for live packet capture.



Logging Tools: To store and review packet data for further analysis.
