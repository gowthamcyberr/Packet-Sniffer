Packet Sniffer 

Objective:

The Packet Sniffer project aims to develop a tool for capturing and analyzing network packets to monitor and troubleshoot network activity. The primary focus is to build a system that can intercept network traffic, parse packet data, and provide insights into network behavior, enabling the identification of potential security threats or performance issues.

Skills Learned:





Network Programming: Proficiency in writing code to capture and analyze packets.



Protocol Knowledge: Deep understanding of network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP).



Data Parsing: Ability to parse and interpret raw packet data accurately.



Security Monitoring: Familiarity with network security concepts for threat detection.



Problem Solving: Enhanced skills in diagnosing and resolving network issues.

Tools Used:





Python (Scapy/Pyshark): For capturing and analyzing network packets programmatically.



Wireshark: For manual inspection and validation of captured packets.



Network Interfaces: Ethernet or Wi-Fi interfaces for live packet capture.



Logging Tools: To store and review packet data for further analysis.

Description: This screenshot shows the initial setup of the packet sniffer tool, including the selection of the network interface for capturing packets and the configuration of filters (e.g., capturing only TCP packets).


Ref 2: Captured Packet Output

Description: This screenshot displays the output of the packet sniffer, showcasing parsed packet details such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocol types.


Ref 3: Wireshark Validation

Description: This screenshot illustrates the use of Wireshark to validate the packets captured by the sniffer, ensuring accuracy in the captured data compared to a standard network analysis tool.
